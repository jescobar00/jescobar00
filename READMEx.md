## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JosÃ© and Iâ€™m a software developer

I enjoy the everyday learning and challenges. At work I stand out for being proactive and committed to my activities
I have experience working with `Java` on native `Android` and on WebApps in `Spring/Hibernate ORM`.
I worked with many DB managers such as `MySQL`, `SqlServer` and mainly with `Oracle`
I also developed apps on `C#`, `ASP.NET`, `VB`, and have knowledge in some frontend tools such as `HTML`, `JS/Jquery`, `CSS`, `JSP`,

â€œI've been working with Android as a Java developer for university
projects. Working with classmates as a team, we shared ideas and
tasks. I liked all that I've learned from that experience, and I would like
to get a job where I can use that knowledge.
Iâ€™d like to invite you to see a video of the project we made on our last
subject. It's thinking to be a management tool for an NGO that gives
scholarships to students to complete their secondary and college
education. Its name is CompaÃ±eros de Caminoâ€œ
